FRIDAY. ST PATRICK'S DAY
The next section I was scheduled to take was Windows SYSMON. However that highly recommended completing two of the CTF's first and THOSE recommended completing the NMAP tutorial first. So I started the NMAP section. Thankfully I already know how nmap works and I understand a lot about TCP/UDP headers and operation thanks to the Cisco Cybersecurity Path course I finished so I'm cruising through the NMAP stuff pretty easily. And my rank on TryHackMe keeps climbing towards the top

Finished the Windows Event Logs learning room. Wow that's a lot of stuff. I feel a bit overwhelmed at time with the tsunami of STUFF but I the more I do and keep pushing on it the more I definitely understand. There's just so many tools and logs all created at different times by different people for different purposes it's difficult to keep it all straight in the beginning. I'll get there eventually. Rank #50260

Worked on the Windows Event Log rooms dealing with Event Viewr, wevtutil.exe and Get-WinEvent (Powershell cmdlet). I finished the Event Viewer and wevutil.exe sections and about half the Get-WinEvent section before I had to go to other chores (such as typing all this out). I'm at 51% on the SOC Level 1 path.

Overall it feels easier than the Cisco training I did
