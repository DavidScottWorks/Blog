Finished the Windows Event Logs learning room. Wow that's a lot of stuff. I feel a bit overwhelmed at time with the tsunami of STUFF but I the more I do and keep pushing on it the more I definitely understand. There's just so many tools and logs all created at different times by different people for different purposes it's difficult to keep it all straight in the beginning. I'll get there eventually.

Worked on the Windows Event Log rooms dealing with Event Viewr, wevtutil.exe and Get-WinEvent (Powershell cmdlet). I finished the Event Viewer and wevutil.exe sections and about half the Get-WinEvent section before I had to go to other chores (such as typing all this out). I'm sitting at Rank #51533 and at 51% on the SOC Level 1 path.

Overall it feels easier than the Cisco training I did
