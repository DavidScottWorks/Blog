Worked on the Windows Event Log rooms dealing with Event Viewr, wevtutil.exe and Get-WinEvent (Powershell cmdlet). I finished the Event Viewer and wevutil.exe sections and about half the Get-WinEvent section before I had to go to other chores (such as typing all this out). I'm sitting at Rank #51533 and at 51% on the SOC Level 1 path.

Overall it feels easier than the Cisco training I did
